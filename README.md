## Overview

### This project aims at analysing a real-world baseball data set in order to predict the salary of a player and to predict the likelihood of a player having scored a Hit.
Two models were build; a Multi-Linear Regression Model to predict the salary of a player and a Logistic Regression to predict the likelihood of a player having scored a Hit.

#### Project Steps
Data Preparation and Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, Modelling (Multi-Linear Regression Model to predict the salary of a player), Modelling (Logistic Regression to predict the likelihood of a player having scored a Hit), Models Critique, Results Interpretation.
